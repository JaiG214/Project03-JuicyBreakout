A game where you break bricks with a ball hit by a paddle until no bricks are left.

## Implementation
Used a pixel font for main menu and game over screen
Changed colors of ball and paddle prefab
Particles shoot out underneath the paddle to add weight to the impact of the ball
Blocks fall into place randomly
Blocks fade in and out
Screen shake only when life is lost
5 lives instead of 3
Ball has a comet effect
Added blockades to level 2 and 3
Made all 3 levels different
Added eyes that follow ball
Made it go to next level when all blocks are destroyed
Added backgrounds to levels
Used Shaders for main menu and game over backgrounds
Added music to menu and game over screen
Sounds for when you hit blocks, paddle, and lose a life

## References
Used Kirby Dreamland and Sonic 2 music for the Main Menu and Levels. For the Game over screen I used AdhesiveWombat - Night Shade.
